# Hacktoberfest
## KickStart to Open Source Event 

## What is Hacktoberfest?
A month-long celebration from October 1st - 31st sponsored by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2433-celebrate-open-source-this-october-with-hacktoberfest) to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). Create your very first pull request and contribute to the open source developer community.

### C. Competetive Programming
* 1. It is interesting to find the factorial of a number, and calculating it is also not a big deal. But geeks it is the hacktober fest  and you have to calculate the factorial using recursion in any language. 
* 2. Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix. Try to optimise for time.
* 3. Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements. Try to solve with Linear Space Complexity.
* 4. Given a string s, reverse the words of the string. Optimise for O(n) time and O(1) space complexities.
* 5. Given an array of N integers, and a number sum, the task is to find the number of pairs of integers in the array whose sum is equal to sum. Optimise for O(n) time and space.
* 6. Given a String, find the length of longest substring without any repeating character. Try to obtain O(n) time and Space Complexity.
* 7. You are given an array ,find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. The solution should be strictly in O(n).
